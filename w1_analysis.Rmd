I need to get the count of seedlings regardless of species and join that with needed data CANOPY COVER, LIGHT INTENSTY, SOIL DEPTH
```{r fix for data that is seperated by plot}
one
#create data frame for number of seedlings by plot ignoring species
sum_seeds <- one %>% group_by(plot_number)%>%summarise(seedling_count = sum(number_of_seedlings))
#c
ind <- one %>% select(plot_number, canopy_cover_percent, light_intensity_lux, soil_depth_cm) 
ind <- unique(ind)
oned <- left_join(sum_seeds, ind, by = "plot_number", )
```

```{r graph of seedling density as a function of percent canopy cover}
# not sure what is meant by seedling density? Should I divide by 1 meter?
ggplot(data = subset.data.frame(oned, !is.na(seedling_count)),aes(x = canopy_cover_percent, y = seedling_count))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = lm)+labs(y = "Seedling Count (# by plot)", x = "% Canopy Cover")
ggsave("canopy.png")
```

```{r graph of seedling density as a function of light intensity}
ggplot(data = subset.data.frame(oned, !is.na(seedling_count)),aes(x = light_intensity_lux , y = seedling_count,))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm")+labs(y = "Seedling Count (# by plot)", x = "Light Intensity (Lux)")
ggsave("lux.png")


```

```{r graph of seedling density as a function of soil depth}
ggplot(data = subset.data.frame(oned, !is.na(seedling_count)),aes(x = soil_depth_cm , y = seedling_count,))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = lm)+labs(y = "Seedling Count (# by plot)", x = "Soil Depth (cm)")
ggsave("soil.png")
```

```{r}
# had to remove for double counted plots also had to rename values to be consistent 
one %>% distinct(plot_number, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% group_by(genus_of_closest_canopy_tree)%>%summarize(count = n()) %>% mutate(current_canopy_dens = count/sum(count))
